# Config prettier with an script

To run the prettier configuration script you will need to:

- Download and save the script setup_prettier.sh in the root of your project.
- Alternatively you should add execute permissions: chmod +x setup_prettier.sh
- Execute the file: ./setup_prettier.sh
- Because the script uses the json dependency, it will ask you to accept its installation. Press “yes” or “y” to continue with the installation.
- Done, you have prettier configured in your project.
