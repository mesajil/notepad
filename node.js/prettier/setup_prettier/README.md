> **Note:** It's not necessary to follow all the steps below; you can simply copy and paste the code into the terminal, and it will work just fine. However, if you want to understand each part of the process, hereâ€™s how to do it manually.

### Steps to Set Up Prettier:

1. **Save the Script**:

   - Save the `setup_prettier.sh` file in the root of your project.

2. **Add Execution Permissions**:

   - To make sure the script is executable, run the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     chmod +x setup_prettier.sh
     ```

3. **Run the Script**:

   - You can run the script in two ways:

     ```bash
     sh setup_prettier.sh
     ```

     or

     ```bash
     ./setup_prettier.sh
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
